# Grow Your Pet

This is the final project for Python Language Foundation and Application, it is a group project.

There is a folder named source code, run the code.py to start the game. In the menu, the player can choose his pet (butterfly, dinosaur, or frog), and then the player will enter the game. The rules a bit similar to 2048, move your arrow keys to merge the fruit/water with the same level to a higher level respectively. Once the fruit/water reaches level 2 or above, the player can click on the particular fruit/water icon to feed the pet. The pet will grow to the next stage if the nutrient level and the water level are reached. Do take note that the game has a time limit. Try to grow your pet as fast as possible!

Note: The game is in Chinese.

More details will be updated soon.
